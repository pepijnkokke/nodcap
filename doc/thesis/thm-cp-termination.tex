\begin{theorem}[Termination]\label{thm:cp-termination}
  If $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$, then there are no infinite $\Longrightarrow$
  reduction sequences.
\end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Every reduction reduces a single cut to zero, one or two cuts.
    However, each of these cuts is \emph{smaller}, in the sense that the type of
    the channel on which the communication takes place is smaller, as each
    reduction eliminates a connective---see
    \cref{fig:cp-preservation-1,fig:cp-preservation-2a,fig:cp-preservation-2b}.
    Therefore, there cannot be an infinite reduction sequence.
  \end{proof}
