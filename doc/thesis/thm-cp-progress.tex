\begin{theorem}[Progress]\label{thm:cp-progress}
  If $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$,
  then either $\tm{P}$ is in canonical form,
  or there exists some $\tm{P'}$ for which $\reducesto{P}{P'}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of derivation for $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$.
  The only interesting case is when the last rule of the derivation is
  \textsc{Cut}. In every other case, the typing rule constructs a term in which
  is in canonical form. 
  \\
  If the last rule in the derivation is \textsc{Cut}, we consider the prefix of
  the derivation for $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma}$ which consists of all top-level
  cuts. A prefix of $n$ cuts introduces $n$ variables, but composes $n+1$
  actions. Therefore, one of the following must be true: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    One of these actions is a link.
    \\
    We apply one of \cpRedAxCut1 or \cpRedAxCut2.
  \item
    Two of these actions, on different sides of a \textsc{Cut}, act on the same channel.
    \\
    Let us name these processes \tm{P_i} and \tm{P_j}, and their shared channel \tm{y}.
    We have:
    \[\!
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \tm{P} & = \quad \text{see above}\\
        \tm{\cpPlug{G}{\cpCut{y}{\cpPlug{H_i}{P_i}}{\cpPlug{H_j}{P_j}}}} &
        \equiv \quad \text{by} \; \cref{thm:cp-display}\\
        \tm{\cpPlug{G}{\cpPlug{H_i}{\cpCut{y}{P_i}{\cpPlug{H_j}{P_j}}}}} &
        \equiv \quad \text{by} \; \cref{thm:cp-display} \; \text{and} \; \cref{thm:cp-preservation-equiv}\\
        \tm{\cpPlug{G}{\cpPlug{H_i}{\cpPlug{H_j}{\cpCut{y}{P_i}{P_j}}}}} & 
      \end{array}
    \]
    We then apply one of the \textbeta-reduction rules.
  \item
    Otherwise (at least) one of the actions acts on a free variable.
    \\
    We then apply one of the commutative conversions.
  \end{itemize}
