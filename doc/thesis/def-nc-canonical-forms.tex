\begin{definition}[Canonical forms]\label{def:nc-canonical-forms}
  A process \tm{P} is in canonical form if it is an action, or if it is of the
  form \tm{\cpPlug{G}{P_1 \dots P_n}}, where \tm{G} is the maximum evaluation
  prefix of \tm{P}, no \tm{P_i} is a link \emph{which acts on a bound channel},
  and no \tm{P_i} and \tm{P_j}, \emph{on different sides of at least one cut}, act on
  the same channel.
