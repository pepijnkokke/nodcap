\begin{theorem}[Preservation]\label{thm:cp-preservation}
  If \reducesto{P}{Q} and $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$, then $\seq[{ Q }]{ \Gamma }$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of the reduction. See
  \cref{fig:cp-preservation-1} for the \cpRedAxCut{i} and \textbeta-reduction
  rules, and \cref{fig:cp-preservation-2a,fig:cp-preservation-2b} for the
  commutative conversions.
  %
  The case for \cpRedGammaCut is trivial by the induction hypothesis, and the
  case for \cpRedGammaEquiv is trivial by the induction hypothesis and
  \cref{thm:cp-preservation-equiv}. 
\end{proof}
