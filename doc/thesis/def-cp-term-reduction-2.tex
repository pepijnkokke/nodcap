\begin{definition}[Term reduction]\label{def:cp-term-reduction-2}
  A reduction $\reducesto{P}{P'}$ denotes that the process \tm{P} can reduce to
  the process \tm{P'} in a single step. Reductions can only be constructed using
  the rules in~\cref{fig:cp-term-reduction-1}.
  % 
  The relation $\Longrightarrow^\star$ is the reflexive, transitive closure of
  $\Longrightarrow$.
