\begin{theorem}[Progress, WHNF]\label{thm:cp-progress-1}
  If $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$, then either $\tm{P}$ is in weak head normal form,
  or there exists a $\tm{P'}$ such that $\reducesto{P}{P'}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of \tm{P}. The only interesting case is the
  case where \tm{P} is a cut \tm{\cpCut{x}{P'}{Q'}}. In every other case,
  \tm{P} is in weak head normal form. There are three possibilities:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Both \tm{P'} and \tm{Q'} act on \tm{x}.
    \\
    We apply one of the \textbeta-reduction rules.
  \item
    Either \tm{P'} or \tm{Q'} acts on an external channel.
    \\
    We apply one of the commutative conversions.
  \item
    Otherwise one or both of \tm{P'} and \tm{Q'} are themselves cuts.
    \\
    We apply the induction hypothesis.
  \end{itemize}
