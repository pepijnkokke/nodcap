\begin{theorem}[Symmetry]\label{thm:cp-symmetry}
  If $\tm{P} \equiv \tm{Q}$, then $\tm{Q} \equiv \tm{P}$.
\end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    By induction on the structure of the equivalence proof.
    The only interesting case is \cpEquivCutAss1, which follows from
    \cref{thm:cp-cut-assoc2}.
  \end{proof}
