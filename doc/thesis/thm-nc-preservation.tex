\begin{theorem}[Preservation]\label{thm:nc-preservation}
  If \reducesto{P}{Q} and $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$, then $\seq[{ Q }]{ \Gamma }$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the structure of the reduction. See
  \cref{fig:cp-preservation-1} for \cpRedAxCut{i} and the \textbeta-reduction
  rules from \cp, and \cref{fig:cp-preservation-2a,fig:cp-preservation-2b} for the
  commutative conversions from \cp.
  See \cref{fig:nc-preservation} for the \textbeta-reduction rules and
  commutative conversions from \nc.
  The cases for \cpRedGammaCut and \ncRedGammaPool are trivial by call to the
  induction hypothesis, and the case for \cpRedGammaEquiv is trivial by call to
  the induction hypothesis and \cref{thm:nc-preservation-equiv}.
