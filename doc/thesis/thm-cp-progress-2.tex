\begin{theorem}[Progress, NF]\label{thm:cp-progress-2}
  If $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$, then either \tm{P} is in normal form, or there
  exists a \tm{P'} such that \reducesto{P}{P'}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Either \tm{P} is in normal form, or there is a cut \emph{somewhere} in \tm{P}.
  If there is a cut, then we obtain a reduction by \cref{thm:cp-progress-1} and
  congruence.
\end{proof}
