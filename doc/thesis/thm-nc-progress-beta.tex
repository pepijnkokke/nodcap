\begin{lemmaB}\label{thm:nc-progress-beta}
  If $\seq[{ \cpPlug{G}{P_1 \dots P_n} }]{ \Gamma }$, and some \tm{P_i} and
  \tm{P_j}, on different sides of at least one cut, act on the same bound
  channel \tm{x}, then there exist \tm{H}, \tm{H_i} and \tm{H_j} such that 
  \(
  \tm{\cpPlug{G}{P_1 \dots P_n}} =
  \tm{\cpPlug{H}{\cpCut{x}{\cpPlug{H_i}{P_i}}{\cpPlug{H_j}{P_j}}}}
  \).
\end{lemmaB}
\begin{proof}
  As \cref{thm:cp-progress-link}.
  The two cases for
  \tm{\ncPool{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1 \dots P_i \dots P_j \dots P_m}}{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1} \dots P_n}}}
  and
  \tm{\ncPool{\cpPlug{G'}{P_1 \dots P_m}}{\cpPlug{G''}{P_{m+1} \dots P_i \dots P_j \dots P_n}}}
  are handled exactly as the cases for cuts which do not bind \tm{x}.
  The case where \tm{P_i} and \tm{P_j} are on different sides of a pool is
  excluded by the type system.
\end{proof}
