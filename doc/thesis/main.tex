\abstract{%
  Process calculi based in logic, such as CP, provide a foundation for
  deadlock-free concurrent programming, but at the cost of excluding
  non-determinism and races.  We introduce \nodcap (nodcap), which extends CP
  with a novel account of non-determinism.  Our approach draws on bounded linear
  logic to provide a strongly-typed account of standard process calculus
  expressions of non-determinism.  We show that our extension is expressive
  enough to capture many uses of non-determinism in untyped calculi, such as
  non-deterministic choice, while preserving CP's metatheoretic properties,
  including deadlock freedom.  We have formalized our calculus and its
  properties using Agda.
