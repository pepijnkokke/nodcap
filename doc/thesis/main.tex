  \abstract{%
    Process calculi based in logic, such as CP, provide a foundation for
    deadlock-free concurrent programming, but at the cost of excluding
    non-determinism and races.  We introduce \nodcap (nodcap), which extends CP
    with a novel account of non-determinism.  Our approach draws on bounded linear
    logic to provide a strongly-typed account of standard process calculus
    expressions of non-determinism.  We show that our extension is expressive
    enough to capture many uses of non-determinism in untyped calculi, such as
    non-deterministic choice, while preserving CP's meta-theoretic properties,
    including deadlock freedom.  We have formalized our calculus and its
    properties using Agda.
