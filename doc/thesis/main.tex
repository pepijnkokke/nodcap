  \abstract{%
    Process calculi based in logic, such as \piDILL and CP, provide a foundation
    for deadlock-free concurrent programming, but at the cost of excluding
    non-determinism and races.
    We introduce \nodcap (nodcap), which extends CP with a novel account of
    non-determinism.
    Our approach draws on bounded linear logic to provide a strongly-typed
    account of standard process calculus expressions of non-determinism.
    We show that our extension is expressive enough to capture many uses of
    non-determinism in untyped calculi, such as non-deterministic choice, while
    preserving CP's meta-theoretic properties, including deadlock freedom.

    I would like to thank Phil Wadler, who taught me that there is no such thing
    as too many examples, and who encouraged my tendency to fill all of them
    with emoji.
    
    I would like to thank Garrett Morris, who saved my half-baked theories so
    often that I've lost count, and for the bakeware---thanks!

    I would like to thank Simon Fowler, who showed me around the Forum on the
    day that I first got to Edinburgh, and who has been wonderfully kind ever
    since.

    And finally, I would like to thank Rudi Horn, Thomas Wright, and all the
    others who helped me during the writing of this dissertation by giving me
    invaluable feedback or simply clarifying little things\ldots
