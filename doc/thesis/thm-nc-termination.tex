\begin{theorem}[Termination]\label{thm:nc-termination}
  If $\seq[{ P }]{ \Gamma }$, then there are no infinite $\Longrightarrow$
  reduction sequences.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Every reduction reduces a single cut to zero, one or two cuts.
  However, each of these cuts is \emph{smaller}, in the sense that the type of
  the channel on which the communication takes place is smaller.
  Each reduction either eliminates a connective, or decreases a resource index
  on the type of a shared channel.
  See
  \cref{fig:cp-preservation-1,fig:cp-preservation-2a,fig:cp-preservation-2b,fig:nc-preservation-1,fig:nc-preservation-2a,fig:nc-preservation-2b}.
  Therefore, there cannot be an infinite $\Longrightarrow$ reduction sequence.
