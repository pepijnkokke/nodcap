\begin{abstract} %TODO you can't just copy your talk abstract
The $\pi$-calculus is great for modeling concurrent systems. However, as a basis
for a programming language it has all sorts of pitfalls---e.g. non-termination,
deadlocks. The system CP, by Wadler (2012), gets rid of many of these pitfalls.
Through a correspondence with linear logic, it guarantees, amongst other things,
termination. However, it also excludes non-determinism, and with that, race
conditions. This makes it a less than ideal tool for modeling concurrent
systems. In this paper, we introduce Nodcap, a variant of CP which allows
non-deterministic programs while still keeping the ties with logic and with that
the guarantees about session fidelity and termination.
